# Welcome to My Docs!
First up, I'd recommend VitePress, which is a static site generator powered by Vue.js. It's optimized for building documentation sites and generates pages from Markdown files.

The default theme has a great, modern aesthetic. It also supports dark-mode out of the box, along with built-in search functionality too. You can also configure Vitepress to add a cover page too, which showcases features of your project's library.

It's super quick to get started with, and is powered by Vite, which makes it blazing-fast ⚡️.
